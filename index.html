<p>My name is <strong>Sékou-Oumar Kaba</strong>, I am a graduate student in machine learning at McGill University and Mila.</p>
<p>I have a background is in physics and my research focuses on designing machine learning models that leverages physical and mathematical insights, primarily for applications in <em>materials science</em> and <em>condesced matter physics</em>.</p>
<p>My interests also include <em>geometric deep learning</em>, <em>statistical mechanics</em> and <em>dynamical systems</em>.</p>
<!-- I have created this blog with mainly three goals in mind. -->
<!-- The first one is for it to serve as a personal archive. I am lucky enough to stumble upon truly beautiful ideas during my research work and readings. Every now and then, I will even have one of my owns. Unfortunately, most get lost to never resurface again. This platform will hopefully keep some of them afloat. -->
<!-- The second one, is that I’ve found that explaining ideas is rewarding way to understand them more deeply. This is especially true when it is possible to strip jargon and heavy formalisms away.   -->
<!-- The last one is the reason I chose the blog format. Ideas benefit from being shared, even when not fruitful or useful enough to belong in official channels. Blog articles helped me on numerous occasions, whether it be on the form of a shared snippet of code, an explanation of an obscure concept, or just giving me food for thought. So if you find something in here interesting, please don't hesitate to comment, share or reach out. -->
